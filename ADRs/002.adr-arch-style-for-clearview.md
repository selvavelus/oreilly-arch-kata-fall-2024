# Arch style for ClearView
Date: 2024-09-24

## Status
Proposed

## Context

As per the requirements We need to build a system which uses an LLM and then we have fetching the data and fetching the report. CRUD and metrics are of microservice style. For asynchronous process like job matching, resume correction, etc these can be event driven. customer facing are microservice and back-end are event driven style
Cost is a major factor as it is a non-profitable organization.
For user experience, latency matters and scalability matters, integration, performance and elasticity.
points of arch style and pick one arch style.
Employers and candidates will use it clearView.

Event driven vs microservice vs service based. Put ranking and select one.



The ClearView (LLM) has to fulfill the requirements of Job seeker as well Employers by act as interface /intermediary between them by enhancing the resume and showing relevant jobs matching their skill sets. After considering various design as explained here and their trade off we have opted for MICROSERVICES + EVENT DRIVEN Architecture.

## Alternatives

* Microservice
* Event driven
* Service oriented

### PrOACT

| Factor         | **Microservices**                                         | **Event-Driven Architecture**                                   | **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability**| Highly scalable. Each service can be scaled independently based on demand. | Dynamic scalability in response to events, enabling real-time adaptation. | Moderate scalability. Scaling services may require more coordination, especially due to centralized control. |
| **Availability**| High availability. If one service fails, others can remain functional. | Event-driven systems can achieve high availability by decoupling services and allowing asynchronous processing. | Moderate to high availability. Centralized services create potential bottlenecks but can use redundancy. |
| **Integration**| Easier integration between services via APIs. Loose coupling supports agile development and third-party service integration. | Integration complexity increases due to asynchronous communication but allows flexibility and modularity. | Integration is generally simpler due to standardized interfaces (SOAP, REST) but more tightly coupled than microservices. |
| **Performance**| Can suffer due to network overhead between microservices but allows better optimization of individual services. | High performance during peak loads by processing events asynchronously, though performance may vary based on event backlog. | Moderate performance. Tight coupling and reliance on a central service bus can create latency under heavy loads. |
| **Cost**       | High operational cost due to managing multiple services, containers, and orchestration. | Moderate cost. Pay-per-event model can optimize costs for variable loads but can increase with high event volume. | Lower upfront costs, but long-term operational costs may rise due to centralized control and integration maintenance. |
| **Latency**    | May experience increased latency due to inter-service communication over the network. | Lower latency for event responses, though there can be delays in event propagation and processing. | Latency can increase due to service bus bottlenecks and synchronous communication. |
| **Elasticity** | High elasticity. Services can independently scale in or out as needed based on traffic. | Very elastic, as services can be provisioned or de-provisioned based on event demand. | Moderate elasticity. Centralized governance of services can slow the ability to respond to rapid demand changes. |
| **Throughput** | Can achieve high throughput by scaling individual services as needed. | High throughput for event-heavy environments, as multiple events can be processed concurrently. | Moderate throughput. Centralized service control can become a bottleneck, affecting throughput under high loads. |

## Decision

* A combination of **Microservice+ Event Driven**
