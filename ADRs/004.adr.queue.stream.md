# Choosing Message queue vs Event stream

## Status
Accepted 

## Context
Clearview system being an event driven system, queue/stream becomes a vital component of the architecture. Platform would need a long term reliable solution to scale for its use cases and build an event sourcing system.

### Alternatives
* Message queue
* Event streams


### PrOACT 

| Criteria      | Message queue | Event stream | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- 
| Reliability      | low       |High, order is preserved
| Delivery count | once | every consumer have their offset  
| Retention | no retention of messages       | retained for a certain period | 
| Cost | low        | high | 
Maintenance overhead | high | less|


## Decision
**Message Queue**
considering use cases of clearview with use cases of event to be delivered instantly for the consumer, the message queue would be the ideal choice here since we prefer the push mechanism of queues.

## Trade-offs
* Complexity - Message queues can add complexity to an architecture. However considering the fact that we are developing the clearview system for a non-profit organisation in termns of cost and usage, message queues are a right fit for our architecture.
