### PrOACT

| Factor         | **Monolithic Architecture**                               | **Event-Driven Architecture**                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability**| Limited scalability. Entire application scales as a whole, leading to over-provisioning of resources. | Highly scalable. Individual services or functions can scale based on the event load, providing more granular control. |
| **Availability**| Lower availability. If one component fails, it can bring down the entire system. | High availability. Failure of one event handler or service doesn't impact the rest of the system, as they are decoupled. |
| **Integration**| Simpler integration internally since everything resides in a single codebase. However, difficult to integrate with external systems or evolve over time. | Flexible integration with external systems and microservices. Event-driven systems allow different services to be added or modified independently. |
| **Performance**| Good performance for small to medium-sized applications, but performance degrades with large, complex systems due to tight coupling. | High performance for dynamic workloads. Events are processed asynchronously, which helps with handling spikes in demand and variable load. |
| **Cost**       | Lower initial development cost, especially for smaller teams, but higher long-term cost due to difficulty in scaling and maintaining. | Moderate cost. Event-driven architectures can optimize cost with pay-per-event models, but costs rise with high event volume and complexity of orchestration. |
| **Latency**    | Potentially lower latency within the system since all components are tightly coupled and communication is direct. | May experience higher latency due to asynchronous communication and event propagation delays, though it provides better handling of high-throughput scenarios. |
| **Elasticity** | Low elasticity. The entire system must scale, leading to inefficient resource utilization during spikes. | High elasticity. The system can automatically adjust to load fluctuations by scaling individual components based on events. |
| **Throughput** | Moderate throughput. All operations are handled synchronously, which can create bottlenecks at high loads. | High throughput. Events are processed independently and asynchronously, allowing the system to handle large volumes of requests concurrently. |

## Decision

**Microservices**
* For better user experience especially for the customer facing roles such as fetching the data, creating the data, form submission and saving, creating analytics it would be a good decision to proceed with **Microservices**
