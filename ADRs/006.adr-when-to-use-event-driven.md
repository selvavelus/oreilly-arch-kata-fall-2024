# When to use event driven

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Back-end services are no less that front-end experiences.

### Alternatives

* Event Driven
* CRON Jobs

### PrOACT

| Factor         | **Event-Driven Architecture**                                   | **CRON Jobs**                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability**| Highly scalable. Event-driven systems allow services to scale in response to event loads, with more granular control. | Limited scalability. CRON jobs run on a fixed schedule, and scaling requires manual changes to job configurations or additional instances. |
| **Availability**| High availability. Independent services or handlers can fail without impacting the overall system. Asynchronous design supports fault tolerance. | Lower availability. If the system where the CRON job runs fails, the job won't execute until recovery, which could cause data or process delays. |
| **Integration**| Flexible integration. Event-driven systems can seamlessly connect with various services, applications, and data streams in real-time. | Simple integration for routine tasks, but less suited for complex, asynchronous tasks. Jobs can trigger other processes, but it lacks dynamic integration capabilities. |
| **Performance**| High performance in handling dynamic and bursty workloads. Events are processed asynchronously and concurrently, allowing the system to handle large volumes of requests. | Moderate performance. CRON jobs can handle scheduled tasks, but they may struggle with dynamic or real-time workloads, and frequent jobs can cause performance degradation. |
| **Cost**       | Moderate cost. Pay-per-event model can help optimize costs, especially for variable event loads. Complexity and infrastructure costs can increase as event volume grows. | Low cost. CRON jobs are simple, and running scheduled jobs has minimal overhead, making them cost-effective for routine, periodic tasks. |
| **Latency**    | Low latency for real-time events. Event-driven systems process events as they happen, but asynchronous processing can introduce slight delays in event propagation. | Higher latency. CRON jobs run on a fixed schedule, which introduces latency for time-sensitive tasks. There is no instant response to changes or events outside the schedule. |
| **Elasticity** | High elasticity. Event-driven systems can automatically scale in response to event volume, adjusting resources dynamically to meet demand. | Low elasticity. CRON jobs donâ€™t dynamically adjust to load; they operate on predefined schedules regardless of traffic spikes or system needs. |
| **Throughput** | High throughput. Event-driven systems process large volumes of events asynchronously, allowing for concurrent handling of tasks. | Moderate throughput. CRON jobs handle tasks sequentially based on their schedule, which limits their ability to handle high-frequency workloads. |

## Decision

**Event driven**
* For back-end asynchronous processes such as job matching, resume correction, etc these can be event drive.
