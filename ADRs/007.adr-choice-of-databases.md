| Factor         | **RDBMS**                                                   | **NoSQL**                                                    |
| -------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability**| Vertical scalability (scale-up) by increasing resources on a single server. Limited horizontal scaling (scale-out) capabilities. | Horizontal scalability (scale-out) is inherent, allowing for easy addition of servers to handle increased load. |
| **Availability**| High availability through clustering and replication, but potential for downtime during maintenance or scaling. | Designed for high availability, often using data replication across multiple nodes to prevent downtime. |
| **Integration**| Well-defined schemas and ACID transactions facilitate integration with enterprise applications and complex queries. | Flexible schemas allow for rapid development and integration with various data types, but may require additional tooling for complex queries. |
| **Performance**| Optimized for complex queries and transactions, providing consistent performance for relational data. Performance can degrade with large volumes of data or complex joins. | Optimized for high-speed read and write operations. Performance can be improved through data denormalization and sharding, especially for large datasets. |
| **Cost**       | Generally higher costs due to licensing, hardware, and administration. | Often lower costs, especially with open-source options and efficient horizontal scaling that utilizes commodity hardware. |
| **Latency**    | Typically low latency for transactions and queries but can increase with complex joins or large datasets. | Generally low latency for read and write operations, especially in systems designed for high throughput. |
| **Elasticity** | Limited elasticity; requires manual intervention to scale resources effectively. | Highly elastic, automatically scaling to accommodate varying workloads and data volumes. |
| **Throughput** | Good throughput for transactional workloads but may struggle under heavy read/write loads or with large datasets. | High throughput, especially designed for big data and real-time analytics scenarios, capable of handling a vast number of concurrent users and requests. |

## Decision
**Document DB & OLAP DB**
* For performing CRUD operations on records, we have decided to go with **Document DB**
* For reporting purpose, the best choice would be **OLAP DB**
