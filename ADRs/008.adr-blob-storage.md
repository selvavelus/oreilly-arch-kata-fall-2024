* blob storage

### PrOACT
| Factor         | **AWS S3 Bucket**                                           | **Azure Blob Storage**                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability**| Highly scalable. S3 automatically scales to handle large volumes of data and high request rates. | Highly scalable. Blob storage scales on-demand, supporting massive amounts of unstructured data with dynamic scalability. |
| **Availability**| Very high availability with features like S3 Standard offering 99.99% availability, and durability of 99.999999999%. | Similar availability with Azure's Locally Redundant Storage (LRS), Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS), and Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) ensuring 99.99% availability. |
| **Integration**| Deep integration within the AWS ecosystem (EC2, Lambda, RDS), plus third-party tool support for data lakes and machine learning. | Seamless integration with Azure services like Virtual Machines, Data Lake, and AI tools, as well as hybrid cloud scenarios with on-prem integration. |
| **Performance**| High performance with intelligent tiering options (S3 Standard, S3 Intelligent-Tiering) and optimized for frequently accessed data. Transfer acceleration improves speed across long distances. | High performance with tiered storage (Hot, Cool, Archive) optimized for different access patterns. Azure Blob's premium block blobs offer low-latency, high-throughput storage for intensive workloads. |
| **Cost**       | Competitive pricing with flexible storage class options based on access frequency, but can become costly with high data retrieval or transfer fees. | Flexible pricing across storage tiers (Hot, Cool, Archive) optimized for different data usage. Similar to S3, costs can increase with data retrieval from lower-cost tiers. |
| **Latency**    | Low latency for frequently accessed data, especially with edge locations and transfer acceleration. Latency may increase for cold storage tiers. | Low latency for frequently accessed data in the Hot tier. Blob Premium storage offers very low latency for high-performance workloads. |
| **Elasticity** | Automatically handles scaling without user intervention, making it highly elastic to support unpredictable workloads. | Offers similar elasticity with automatic scaling of resources based on demand, supporting elastic applications. |
| **Throughput** | Can achieve high throughput with S3 Transfer Acceleration and multi-part uploads for large objects. | Comparable throughput. Premium Blob storage offers high performance for I/O-intensive operations, and multi-part uploads support large objects. |
