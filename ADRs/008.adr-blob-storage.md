# Blob storage

## Status
Accepted

## Context
There is always a need to persist files or different format which are totally unstructured. Especially when we are dealing with sensitive information of candidates across the globe and providing global access to employers who are in need considering cost effectiveness.

### Alternatives
* AWS S3 buckets
* blob storage

### PrOACT
| Factor         | **AWS S3 Bucket**                                           | **Azure Blob Storage**                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability**| Highly scalable. S3 automatically scales to handle large volumes of data and high request rates. | Highly scalable. Blob storage scales on-demand, supporting massive amounts of unstructured data with dynamic scalability. |
| **Availability**| Very high availability with features like S3 Standard offering 99.99% availability, and durability of 99.999999999%. | Similar availability with Azure's Locally Redundant Storage (LRS), Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS), and Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) ensuring 99.99% availability. |
| **Integration**| Deep integration within the AWS ecosystem (EC2, Lambda, RDS), plus third-party tool support for data lakes and machine learning. | Seamless integration with Azure services like Virtual Machines, Data Lake, and AI tools, as well as hybrid cloud scenarios with on-prem integration. |
| **Performance**| High performance with intelligent tiering options (S3 Standard, S3 Intelligent-Tiering) and optimized for frequently accessed data. Transfer acceleration improves speed across long distances. | High performance with tiered storage (Hot, Cool, Archive) optimized for different access patterns. Azure Blob's premium block blobs offer low-latency, high-throughput storage for intensive workloads. |
| **Cost**       | Competitive pricing with flexible storage class options based on access frequency, but can become costly with high data retrieval or transfer fees. | Flexible pricing across storage tiers (Hot, Cool, Archive) optimized for different data usage. Similar to S3, costs can increase with data retrieval from lower-cost tiers. |
| **Latency**    | Low latency for frequently accessed data, especially with edge locations and transfer acceleration. Latency may increase for cold storage tiers. | Low latency for frequently accessed data in the Hot tier. Blob Premium storage offers very low latency for high-performance workloads. |
| **Elasticity** | Automatically handles scaling without user intervention, making it highly elastic to support unpredictable workloads. | Offers similar elasticity with automatic scaling of resources based on demand, supporting elastic applications. |
| **Throughput** | Can achieve high throughput with S3 Transfer Acceleration and multi-part uploads for large objects. | Comparable throughput. Premium Blob storage offers high performance for I/O-intensive operations, and multi-part uploads support large objects. |

## Decision
**Blob storage**
* Handling Large Volumes: As applications flood in, resumes in different file formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.) need to be stored efficiently. Blob storage offers unlimited, scalable storage to accommodate these growing files.
* Secure Storage: With sensitive personal information on resumes, blob storage provides encryption and role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access the files.
* Global Access: HR teams, especially in global companies or remote setups, need access to resumes from anywhere. Blob storage offers seamless, secure global accessibility.
* Cost Efficiency: Storing resumes for long periods, especially for compliance or future hiring, becomes costly. Blob storage offers tiered pricing, allowing less-frequently accessed resumes to be stored more economically.
